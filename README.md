This project was born from the need to have in one place all the people, companies and other entities of the Timisoara local startup ecosystem.

In order for us to grow as a community, we need to know each other first.

This is an open-sourced project. Anybody that wants to help, can contribute to it. For now, the publication of the changes/update on the actual website (http://TimisoaraStartups.com) will be made manually by me, but we can look and discuss ways of automate this (but still have some moderation in place).

If you just want to edit the data published on the site, you'll find the JSON files in app/data/. 

For any discussions regarding this project, or any other startup related topic, you can reach me at andrei.firoiu@gmail.com.
